Robo Instructus alpha-1.3 is out today as the latest improvement on the alpha experience. This week sees more reworking of the early game to smoothen the initial experience. A new level is in, and tutorials have been reworked and shifted about. Also we have a bunch of new features in the editor for those that have worked out the language and just want to get coding!

### Early game changes
As I get a better idea of what people find confusing when first looking at the game I can start addressing the issues. This week I've tried to reduce player frowning when discovering the ***robo_scan()*** function. I've added a new level to complete when you first get ability, the level is much more stripped down and will allow players to focus on just how ***robo_scan()*** works rather than anything else.

Another new feature of this version is level *RECOVERED CODE FRAGMENT* messages. These incomplete slices of code that will may greet you as you progress to a new level. Right now they serve to give players a starting point as they stretch their legs in the game world.

Work continues on perfecting the tutorials. Teaching is hard, but I'm trying to improve. I've reworked the tutorial for ***robo_current_location()***/***robo_forward_location()*** as I'd received a lot of clarification requests on these ones. Hopefully these make a little more sense now, have a gander alpha testers.

### Editor improvements
The alpha testers more familiar with boshing out code in a decent editor have been asking for some quality of life editor features. I'm happy to say we now have a bunch more shortcuts and features you'd expect of a decent code bothering tool. Lets have a look.

So the game is a little more pleasant to code in now. There are also more improvements like copy-paste using the system clipboard, and improve errors messages for things like incorrect indenting. It's all part of making the game a better experience.
