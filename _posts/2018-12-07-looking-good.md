Look, I know this devblog has been pretty hard work for people with eyes. For a year and a half I've been prattling on about Robo Instructus all the while posting image after image of my frankly criminal placeholder art. Well it's time to take off those protective glasses normally reserved for eclipses, the initial batch of game art has arrived!

Behind the tile art you'll see the final background for the first environment, Tom has put a ton of detail into this background and it looks fantastic. You can now finally see it tying in with the tile art themes.

I actually haven't finished integrating all the assets in the first batch properly yet, but I couldn't resist posting the progress today. Mostly because I'm totally sick of the placeholder art at this point. It just feels great to see the game finally stepping closer to how it should really look.

Tom won't be resting after this though, there is much still to do. The facility background, other environment variations of the tiles and the biggest job; the robot's art and animations. So yes the placeholder robot is still clinging on inside the game, but this low-pixel robot's days are definitely numbered.
