With the new levels almost all coming after the _alpha-1_ levels it's not surprising these will require a little more effort. Getting our little robot to the exit tile will never be easy, players will have to stretch every tool they have to the purpose. Building on the [Making The Jump](/2018/01/19/making-the-jump.html) post; let's take another look at what Robo Instructus has in store.

### More detection tools
Sometimes before we ask for more, we have to give a little ourselves. Games are no different, that's why new toys will become available as the game goes on. Like ***robo_detect_3()***, which is somewhat similar to ***robo_detect_adjactent()***.

It'll be fully explained in-game, of course. But you can probably work it out if you're familiar with later levels of _alpha-1_.

New tools are one thing, but making effective use of them is something else. By properly reviewing the levels arrayed against you, can you see a way past seemingly impregnable obstacles?

How about ***robo_detect_3()*** and the launcher tiles:

My work continues on new tools and levels, more info coming soon.
