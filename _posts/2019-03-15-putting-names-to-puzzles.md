Today I released the beta-1.3 update for Robo Instructus. It brings a nice chunk of quality of life improvements to the game based on the feedback I've received. One of these is, each level now has a name.

## Level names
Naming levels was requested by multiple sources and this surprised me even though I had been planning on adding level names eventually. Names are pretty useful though if you want to talk about a particular level without having to count rows and account for multiple level rows. So this is a good feature to have if you want to complain about a level.

They also provide a little flavour about the puzzle itself or a possible solution. Although so indirectly that I don't think they'll actually provide any help if you're struggling. Let's take a look at a few of them.

***Hello Robo*** is, of course, a play on "Hello, World" as this is the very first level.

***Use Your Powers Wisely*** is the recently introduced early game level where players puzzle out power switches. You have to ***robo_use()*** power switches in this level, so I'm sure you can see how I came to this name.

***The Deductive Dance*** is my favourite puzzle in the beta. Solve it and see if you think this name makes sense!

## Moving directions underground
Another change in beta-1.3 is both direction levels are now underground. In some ways this is quite a minor change, you still face the level at around the same time. However, it has a major advantage in that players will be able to complete the above-ground introduction levels before they get stuck on this one. I hope finishing the scaffold levels and revealing the underground ones will give players a boost to help them get into the much harder puzzles below.
