title: Unveiling The Arc

This week I've been working on improving the level selection "facility view". This screen is going to look empty until the art background arrives, but I can still improve the systems that underlie it. One thing I'd like to talk about is an idea suggested to me that a whole section, or "arc", of levels unveil together as you unlock them, rather than always seeing the next couple of upcoming levels.

The game is already split into 4 arcs, each introducing new challenges, art & music. By unveiling them together, and not unveiling others until the current is complete, the arcs feel more distinct. It makes sense that the idea came from a game writing session as this effect also adds a little drama & syncs in with the themes of discovery.

I've also added smooth, cubic eased scrolling to the screen, which is nicely re-used in the auto scroll unveiling of the arc.

_Skip to 0:20 for the unveiling._

<div class="video-wrap">
  <iframe width="850" height="478"

    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen>
  </iframe>
</div>

I need to sprinkle some sound and art on this but I'm happy with the core of the idea.

There are still many improvements I want to make to this screen. Previewing a visited level before you click & a summary of your scores would be nice. The buttons will need a look once the background arrives too. Lots of potential improvements I think.

If you're testing the game and have any ideas about the facility view let me know!
