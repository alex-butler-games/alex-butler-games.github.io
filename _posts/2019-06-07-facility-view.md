Robo Instructus' release is looming yet the facility view / level selection screen _still_ hasn't seen too many improvements. Until now that is, today's [**beta-3.1** update](https://github.com/big-ab-games/robo-instructus/releases/tag/beta-3.1) is coming to the rescue.

**Beta-3.1** brings a bunch of improvements to the facility view.

* New level node art.
* Hovering now renders the name of known levels.
* Final quality facility background art.
* Facility fog below known levels.
* Improve new game highlighting of the first node.

The new node icon are looking great & having the level name appear on hover is a big help for remembering which level is which.

The latest update also has new community translations for the interface in <b>Italiano</b> & <b>Ελληνικά</b>. It's great to have more languages available, let me say, once again, a huge thanks to the contributors to [big-ab-games/robo-instructus-translation](https://github.com/big-ab-games/robo-instructus-translation).

Also new is a _Credits_ options in the title (profile selection) screen that lets anyone view the game credits, instead of having to actually finish all the puzzles.

If you've sent me feedback on the beta or helped with translations you should be in the credits. So take a look and let me know loudly if I missed you out or got your name wrong!
