The Robo Instructus alpha stage continues. With the testers being fairly quiet this week I'm concentrating on my backlog of alpha features. Currently in the oven is a replacement for the _available functions_ list which is currently just a generated comment in the players code.

This is a button you can press to show a list of the available functions with brief explanations. Unlike the current comments it'll be presented more like markup, won't be editable and will click through to more detailed documentation / tutorials.

It's another small piece of the puzzle providing clarity and ease when looking up explanations of functions and code concepts. Having to re-read docs is going to be part of the early game for most so I'm trying to make it as painless as possible _(not currently the case in alpha-1.4)_.

As I'm on holiday a bunch of this and next week progress is a little slower, this feature is still baking. So hold on and look out for this in the next alpha!
