preface: robo-2

The last few weeks have slowed a little as I took a short holiday and attained an office dog. Work continues on the final concurrency levels of Robo Instructus. Having a new puppy to deal with while I work is kind of fitting as I'll need to do 2 things at once to deliver concurrency in the game.

Above: My original concept placeholder art for the star of Robo Instructus.

The bulk of the concurrency refactor is now complete. A lot of the previous assumptions of a single codeable robot now change, but the same concepts can be reused in collection/map structures within the code to allow multiple sources of executable user-code. The game now needs to be smarter with concepts like focus, handling errors from more than a single place, etc.

I've had to stash a lot of exciting ideas for the game so I can finish it in a timely manner and that it won't be too long. It's already stuffed with lots of stuff, and I'd rather it was short, sweet & cheap than too long. My current aim for the game is something like 6-8 hours of entertainment for the very quick. However, this will need a lot of play-testing to see for real. Puzzle games are hard to judge this way.

This month I'll be continuing to tend to my new pup and to work towards finishing this vital conceptual puzzle piece for the final part of the game.
