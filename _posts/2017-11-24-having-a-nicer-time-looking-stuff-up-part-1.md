title: Having a Nicer Time Looking Stuff Up
---

Last time I was talking about the next feature for Robo Instructus [_A Reference For Humans_](/2017/11/10/a-reference-for-humans.html). That's landing today in alpha-1.5. This is just step 1 though, more improvements to this area are incoming.

So the generated comment summary is history, and we have a blue box with the available functions for the level. It can't be edited, takes up less space and _feels_ more separated from the actual code to help players focus a little more.

The new summary will also be visible even scrolled down larger solutions, but can also be hidden easily. Overall a nice improvement on the old placeholder solution.

As mentioned this is a small but significant step towards a better experience learning the game. Next step will involve having the function and language tutorials on the right hand side as you code. With that in the old necessity to re-open the tutorial info with _'View Level Info'_ will be gone.

So look forward to that and in the meantime enjoy this iterative improvement.
