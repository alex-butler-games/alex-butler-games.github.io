_To celebrate 2 years Robo Instructus is 50% off on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1032170) & [itch.io](https://bigabgames.itch.io/robo-instructus) for the next 7 days._

The game has received 9 updates over the year, the latest _1.31.4_. Most notably the game completed a full German translation thanks to community contribution _(all translations are done in the open so anyone can help improve [them on github](https://github.com/big-ab-games/robo-instructus-translation))_.
The updates also brought QoL improvements like auto-scrolling to code errors/while debugging, along with bug fixes and code maintenance.

### Achievements

Looking at a couple of choice Steam achievements, **The Gist** which you get for completing the 4th level _(ie you've actually had a go at the game)_ is 63.6%, up from 60.9 last year. **Open The Vault** which you get for completing the game is at 0.8%, up from 0.7. So more people have played, and a few have even managed to complete, the game this year. Good job!
