Last week's alpha release allowed players to see where their scores fell compared with other engineers around the <s>world</s> alpha testing group, by fetching the data and rendering graphs. This week the _alpha-1.12_ release brings small but important improvements to the graphs: **Tracking your best scores**.

In _alpha-1.11_ you could see your latest score and how it compared with others. But though the game _did_ remember your best scores, it didn't actually show you. In _alpha-1.12_ what we want to see appears, you'll see your best scores in each area along with the latest score in a dashed line.

It's your best scores that get uploaded to the global database and compared with other players. Though your 3 best scores may have required 3 totally different solutions to achieve them. For example your best **solution** score could be slow as hell in terms of **time**. Each best score will upload the all 3 scores, so each player can provide 3 different scores in each category per level.

When we get around to comparing with friends via steam or similar it'll just use your 3 best scores.

While improvements can still be made to the end-of-level stats, they are in good enough shape for me to direct my attention once again to finishing the final game levels. If you're an alpha tester please get back to me with feedback on the stats and graphs.
